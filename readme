Script Calculate the total stake on the account from all  withdrawers  and the total amount.
If the script is called without parameters, it looks for the file ~/solana/vote-account-keypair.json  in the current directory. 
Otherwise, you need to specify a public key for counting. If the request is made to another network, then the second parameter 
must be specified as -ut or -um, respectively.
